## ðŸ§ª Requirements

Your app must:

1. **Authenticate with Spotify**
   - Use the [Implicit Grant Flow](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/tutorials/implicit-flow) or any secure method to get an access token.
   - Youâ€™ll need to create an app on the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/).

2. **Display this content** from the Spotify API:
   - **Released This Week**  
     â†’ `GET /browse/new-releases`
   - **Featured Playlists**  
     â†’ `GET /browse/featured-playlists`

3. Have a responsive and engaging UI:
   - Feed-style layout
   - Cards with album/playlist images, titles, and subtitles
   - A clean grid layout that works well on both mobile and desktop  
     â†’ Ideally, implement **infinite scroll** if the API supports pagination
